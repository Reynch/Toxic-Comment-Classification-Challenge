# Goal
The goal of this project is to create a filter that can be used to identify toxic comments/messages to provide users a better online experience by removing toxicity from their feeds.
To accomplish this goal I will be using different machine learning models such as: Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classifier, and Convolutional Neural Networks.
